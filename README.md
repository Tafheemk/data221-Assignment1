File Descriptions

Question 1 Controlled Multiplication Loop
This file contains code that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a given threshold value. It keeps track of the threshold, the running product, and the multiplier that caused the product to exceed the threshold.

Question 2 Nested Dictionary from Strings
This file defines a function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where each word maps to its length and whether that length is even or odd. The function loops through each word and builds a nested dictionary with the required information.

Question 3 Safe Function Application
This file creates a power function and safely applies it to a list of number pairs. Any pair with a negative exponent is skipped, and only valid results are stored and printed.

Question 4 Sorted Search with Conditions
This file generates a list of random numbers, sorts it, and compares the values to a randomly generated number x. It prints the sorted list, the value of x, and the first index where the list value is greater than or equal to x if one exists.

Question 5 Circle Area Comparison with Validation
This file defines a function that validates two circle radii and calculates the percentage of the larger circle that can be covered by the smaller one. If the input is invalid, an appropriate message is returned instead of performing the calculation.

Question 6 Distribution Analysis
This file defines a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary of cumulative percentages. Each key represents a unique value from the list and each value shows the percentage of elements less than or equal to that key.

Question 7 Time Conversion Function
This file contains a function that converts seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM or PM format. The function validates the input and returns the time in a readable 12 hour format.

Question 8 Pandas DataFrame with Computed Column
This file creates a pandas DataFrame using provided data and adds a new column calculated from existing columns. The final updated DataFrame is printed to show the computed results.
